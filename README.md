Logistic regression is a method used for the estimation or prediction of a binary outcome after a continuous learning phase. In the context of statistics, the term 'regression' in logistic regression refers to identifying the relationship between the independent variable (X) and the binary dependent variable (Y). This relationship is typically modeled using the logistic function.  Each pair constitutes a data point or data record. The implementation involves estimating the cost function, which is integral to understanding the performance of the logistic regression model. The cost function, in this case, is related to the disparity between the actual and predicted binary outcomes. Unlike linear regression, logistic regression deals with classification problems where the dependent variable is binary (e.g., 0 or 1). The logistic regression model computes probabilities and applies the logistic (sigmoid) function to map the output to a probability range between 0 and 1. The cost function is pivotal in logistic regression as it guides the optimization process by determining the gradient of the weights that establish the relationship between the independent variable and the log-odds of the binary outcome.
