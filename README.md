Logistic regression is a method used for the estimation or prediction of a binary outcome after a continuous learning phase. In the context of statistics, the term 'regression' in logistic regression refers to identifying the relationship between the independent variable (X) and the binary dependent variable (Y). This relationship is typically modeled using the logistic function.
